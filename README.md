# Optimal-Scheduling-of-Electric-Vehicle
In this Project Scheduling of Electric Vehicle is done through various algorithm . the main motive to fulfill user’s and charging Station requirement to minimize the waiting time for user and overall time in which all EVS get charged, and more no. of EVS will get charged. First Come First Serve , Shortest Job first , Priority Based according to Deadline if deadline same then according to FCFS  and optimized algorithm (consist of all solutions) is used to schedule the EVS.
